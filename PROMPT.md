I want to understand how _claude code_ works, so I ask you to help me and provide necessary information for me as explained in this text prompt. 
First, _claude code_ is an agentic ai assistant which can turn your ideas into working code. Use internet search in order to find out how it works. 
I provide my needs and rules and recourses in following steps and your duty is to provide a clean well-crafted document for me based on the explanations. 

## Needs

- What tools/libraries are most needed? (assuming the project is being coded in python)
- What methods are needed? (for _tool calling approach_)
- How can this project become a more serious one? (currently it's a personal spare time project and nothing more.)

## Rules

- Do NOT write any code. Just provide titles and names for tools. 
- Tool names must be comprehensive _snake case_ python names, all in lowercase letters. 
- No classes are allowed. OOP is banned in this household. 

## Resources

- Multiple OpenAI compatible API's (Open Router, Novita, Nebius, Fal AI)
- Ollama resource (local and cloud)
- A 3050 GPU on a gaming laptop 
- Multiple GPU pods on RunPod (around $200 worth of credits)
- Possibilities of grants from different companies (like Modal)

Based on these, design the best game plan possible.
